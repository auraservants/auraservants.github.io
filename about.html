            <p class="about-text">My name is Aura, and I am a digital designer with over 7 years of experience. I specialized in frontend development, another one of my passions. I began my undergraduate studies at the University of Margarita in Venezuela, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Arts with a major in Graphic Design. I graduated in 2016, and shortly after, in 2017, I moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina.
                <br><br>
                Since my time at university, I kept myself busy by doing freelance design work of all kinds. During my university internship, I worked at a well-known local agency that had clients from all over the world.
                <br><br>
                In Buenos Aires, I started working for small agencies and niche industries, where I was in charge and responsible for the design and marketing departments.
                <br><br>
                During the pandemic, I decided to take a short career course in software development with a specialization in frontend development. I received a scholarship for this course and completed it in 2023. I have always been passionate about web design, which led me to shift my focus to this area.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I work as a digital designer at VML, formerly known as Wunderman Thompson, a multinational marketing and technology company. Here, I have worked with various global clients such as <i style="font-size:20px">Kyndryl, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Movistar, Philip Morris, and currently, <span style="color: blueviolet;font-weight: bold;">L'Oréal.</span></i>
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I take on freelance projects across various fields, including branding, web design and development, email marketing, social media, and more.

                            <br><br>
                            I typically work out 6 times a week and also do CrossFit. In general, I enjoy physical activity, and I’m particularly passionate about taking long walks, especially outdoors, to enjoy nature. I love any plans that involve this. I also really enjoy eating, and one of my favorite dishes is sushi. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with friends, and overall, I spend a lot of time on my computer. I tried playing the piano but gave it up for other passions. However, I’d love to pick it up again at some point in the near future.

                            <br><br>
                            I love board games; it's always a great plan with friends or family. I really value time like that, especially when there are lots of laughs involved. I used to play basketball when I was younger, and I even competed professionally on women's teams, representing our state.
                            Last but not least, I absolutely love animals, especially dogs and cats. Throughout my life, I’ve had two pets: a little dog during my childhood and another one when I was older. Both are no longer with me, but I remember them every day. In the future, I’d love to have a pet again.
